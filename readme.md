# Datathon24 - Kaggle Competition

## Overview  
This repository contains code and resources for the Datathon24 Kaggle competition. The challenge involves building a model to predict the design attributes of a product based on its image and metadata.

## Pipeline  
1. **Feature Extraction**: A pre-trained model is used to extract embeddings from product images.  
2. **Invalid Attribute Detection**: A gradient boosting model identifies whether a product attribute is invalid.  
3. **Attribute Value Prediction**: A neural network predicts attribute values for valid products.
